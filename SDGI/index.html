        <center><p> In a world of emerging markets, the internet and network systems have certainly been the epicenter of the <strong>Electronic Age</strong>. Growing up we i always told spending so time on the computer would get me nowhere in life. The statement today would hold water. The demand for software developer is vast and has seen an increase of almost 40% in 2019 with over 1.9 million jobs with and expectoed increase of 22% in the next 10 years. Rapid grownth in mobile apps and systems maintenance will support this growth in the coming years. </p></center>

        <b><center><p>"<ins> Coding skills are in high demand in a broad range of careers</ins>, not just for programmers. Coding skills could be valuable to people working with information technology (IT), data analytics, design, marketing, business, engineering, and science, to mention a few.  As the coding jobs grow faster than the job market, to learn how to code could be considered as one of the most useful skills to obtain in todayâ€™s world." </p></center>

        <center><p> What makes a job feel like work? In my opinion, not having a genuine passion for what you do is what can make a job feel like work. For me, <mark>computer science and software has always been a dream of mine</mark>. The only thing that held me back was my fear of code and this foreign laugage. That moment of anxiety when you accidentally hit the F12 button and these <sup>array of</sup> numbers, code, and commands that came up seemed to me as an impossible feat to learn. As i grew older my fear slowly deminished. Today i still am a bit intimifated bythe advancements but with this course i feel i will have the tools to pursue and excel in a career in software engineering.</p></center>

        <center><p> As the years pass, the ease of use for website and app development will bring down the demand for software engineers. <del>User interfaces can and will replace third party developers.</del> For now, coders, designers, and those who are pursing IT are the future of the standard operating funtionality of the world. This is why i chose to study and purse a career in coding. </p></center>
